Updating your DiUS consultant summary is **HARD**.

The reason it is **HARD** is because:

  * A Consultant Summary contains too much information, especially employment history.
  * A Consultant Summary is dependent on Microsoft Word. Most consultants do not have Microsoft products installed.

The primary goal of __Profiles__ is to make the Consultant Summary **ACCESSIBLE**

  * Accessible to consultants.
  * Accessible to clients.
  * Accessible to account managers.

__Profiles__ should also demonstrate our ability to create nice things. We give these things
to our clients and prospective client so we want them to:

  * Use the web technologies we work with everyday.
  * Use a responsive design.

DiUS have already invested effort into improving the Consultant Summary. We have taken this
design and modified it for the Web.

### Other stuff we have learnt

  * Traditional resumes are becoming less important in the industry we work.
  * __Profiles__ should sell our culture and personality.
  * __Profiles__ need to be printed on A4 paper.
  * Clients don't believe what is written in them.
  * Clients would be happy to endore experience/skills for consultants.
  * __Profiles__ need to be secure with restriced access.
  * Encourage people to participant in activities that develop their own public profile.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to __Profiles__
